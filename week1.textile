Add the following line to your *~/.bashrc* file (or your other shell-specific profile file):

pre. [[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"

Run the following command and execute the commands listed under "For Ruby (MRI & ree) you should install the following OS dependencies:"
