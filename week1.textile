h1. Week 1 Coursework

h2. Installing Ruby

h3. Windows

Install Ruby *1.9.2* using the installer available on the "RubyInstaller Downloads Page":http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

h3. Mac

Ruby and RubyGems are already preinstalled on recent Mac OS versions.  The versions that come preinstalled are not recommended for use in development, but since the course will use a virtual machine (described later), they will suffice.  No further action is required at this point.

h3. Linux

Using your distribution's package manager, install *git* and *curl*.  For instance, on Ubuntu, run the following at the command line:

{% highlight bash %}
apt-get install git curl
{% endhighlight %}

*DO NOT* install Ruby or Rails using your distribution's package manager.

After installing git and curl, run the following the command to install *rvm*, Ruby Version Manager:

{% highlight bash %}
bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )
{% endhighlight %}

Add the following line to your *~/.bashrc* file (or your other shell-specific profile file):

{% highlight bash %}
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
{% endhighlight %}

Run the following command and execute the commands listed under "For Ruby (MRI & ree) you should install the following OS dependencies:"

{% highlight bash %}
rvm notes
{% endhighlight %}

For instance, on Ubuntu Linux, run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
aptitude install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev autoconf
{% endhighlight %}

With all of the dependencies satisfied, run the following command to install Ruby:

{% highlight bash %}
rvm install 1.9.2
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, make that version of Ruby the default:

{% highlight bash %}
rvm use --default 1.9.2
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Installing VirtualBox

To make sure everyone uses the same environment, this course will use a Linux virtual machine preconfigured with a Ruby on Rails environment.

Install VirtualBox *3.2*, available on the "VirtualBox download page":http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_3_2.  Download the correct version for your operating system.

VirtualBox is freely available under the "VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License":http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL.

h2. Installing Preconfigured VM

Open a command line and run the following command to install *Vagrant*:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install vagrant
{% endhighlight %}
