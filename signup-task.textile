h1. Sign Up Task

*NOTE:* If you get stuck at any point, join the IRC chatroom at "irc.freenode.net#p2pu-rubyrails":irc://irc.freenode.net#p2pu-rubyrails or post in the "forums":http://p2pu.org/node/13622/forums.

h2. Installing VirtualBox

To make sure everyone uses the same environment, this course will use a Linux virtual machine preconfigured with a Ruby on Rails environment.

Install VirtualBox *3.2*, available on the "VirtualBox download page":http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_3_2.  Download the correct version for your operating system.

VirtualBox is freely available under the "VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License":http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL.

h2. Installing Ruby &amp; Vagrant

Follow the appropriate documentation for your operating system to install Ruby and related dependencies:

* "Windows [32-bit]":http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/setup/windows.html
* "Windows [64-bit]":http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/setup/windows_x64.html
* "Mac OS X":http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/setup/mac.html
* "Linux [Ubuntu]":http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/setup/ubuntu.html

*Windows Users*: Also install *"PuTTY":http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html* using the Windows installer.

After following that guide, install the *vagrant* gem (library) by running the following at the command line:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install vagrant -v 0.6.9
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Installing the Rails Environment

Download the *"Engine Yard University's Vagrant environment":http://s3.amazonaws.com/EY5/vagrant.zip* and unzip it.

Change directory to the folder where you unzipped *vagrant.zip*:

{% highlight bash %}
cd /path/to/unzipped/file
{% endhighlight %}

Load the virtual machine:

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant box add eyu package.box
{% endhighlight %}

*Windows Users:* If at any point you receive an error when using vagrant, you may need to follow the directions "in this email":http://groups.google.com/group/vagrant-up/msg/2328acdd86577fd9 to reinstall the JSON gem.  Thanks Tyler Cipriani for the tip!

Start the virtual machine:

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant up
{% endhighlight %}

Login to the virtual machine:

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant ssh
{% endhighlight %}

*Windows Users:* The _vagrant ssh_ command will cause an error.  To interact with the virtual machine, you need to use *PuTTY* (installed earlier).  Please follow the "Vagrant SSH on Windows instructions":http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/setup/windows.html#ssh to setup and use PuTTY.  Go through the final step and click "Open" to connect to the virtual environment.

_*TASK:* So I can verify that you correctly setup the environment, run the following command and send the output, along with your to P2PU username, to <a href="mailto:&#112;&#050;&#112;&#117;&#064;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#121;&#108;&#105;&#110;&#100;&#101;&#109;&#097;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#112;&#050;&#112;&#117;&#064;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#121;&#108;&#105;&#110;&#100;&#101;&#109;&#097;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>_.

{% highlight bash %}
hostname
{% endhighlight %}

_*TASK:* Also in your email, include a program in your language of choice that accepts a sentence and reverses the words.  For example: given "I like dogs" the program should output "dogs like I"_.

After you have completed that task, you have successfully setup the environment that the course will use throughout.

To teardown, run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
exit
{% endhighlight %}

Return to your regular machine's command prompt and type:

{% highlight bash %}
vagrant destroy
{% endhighlight %}
